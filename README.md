ShapeStorm by Abheek Tuladhar
=============================

In ShapeStorm, the user is a green block who is at the bottom of the screen. The objective of ShapeStorm is to shoot down a continuous storm of falling shapes to protect your ship so you can go back to your home planet. These falling shapes come from the top of the screen and have varying speeds, sizes,  and abilities, which make them more difficult to shoot over time. Some examples are dashing, a single teleportation, dodging abilities, and more.
The controls for the user are moving left and right with A and D; use the space bar to fire bullets. Over time, the bullets get upgrades at around the same rate that the enemies are evolving, so that the levels are possible.
Occasionally, especially at higher levels, power-ups will pop onto the screen below the halfway line. Some examples are a shield for the player, a slow-motion effect for the enemies, a reload speed getting lower, and the plague, which would kill all enemies that go past the halfway point. These effects are temporary and donâ€™t last more than a couple of seconds. You can carry these power-ups in your inventory, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. If I got the shield, it would go in my inventory in the number 1 slot, and when I clicked 1, a shield would activate. If you have 4 power-ups and collect another, it replaces the number 1 spot.
As shown in the image below, directions will be on the right and stats will be in the middle. The main gameplay is on the right, where the enemies come out of dispensers. There is a pause button in the top right corner if you want to read the directions while not playing. The game additionally starts paused to give you a chance to read.
Although the game is simple to learn, it is difficult to master, which is my favorite kind of game.
